# PotholeReportingApp
Every single year, Kenya loses hundreds of its citizens due to potholes in our poorly constructed
roads. Most of the accidents occur as drivers try to avoid potholes so they end up ramming onto
other oncoming vehicles or pedestrians. Potholes are also an annoyance in that they cause loses of
billions of dollars in vehicle damages. The question comes in, how does the government identify
and repair these potholes? KURA for example uses a lot of funds surveying and identifying the
specific points where there are potholes in Kenyan urban roads. There is also a lot of negligence
in the officers who undertake this duty of identifying these potholes in that they donâ€™t do their job
effectively. So the problem comes in, how can we automate the process of identifying the potholes
and thus eliminate most of the problems which will lead to faster repair of the potholes? That is
why I have decided to come up with this mobile application which will involve the citizens in
helping the government identify the potholes and also the same citizens making sure the pothole
is repaired. The app will be connected to a camera and once one notices a pothole, the take a picture
of it and upload it to the database. The photo will automatically attach the specific coordinates of
the place where it was taken thus making it easy to trace the specific point. Once the repair has
been done, KURA can take a picture of the same place and upload it thus showing that an initiative
was taken.
